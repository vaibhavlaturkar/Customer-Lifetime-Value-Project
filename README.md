#Customer Segmentation, Customer Behaviour Prediction and Product Recommendation Using Customer Lifetime Value

                                                        ABSTRACT
Customer lifetime value (CLV) is the discounted sum of future cash flows attributed to the relationship with a customer. In simple terms, CLV estimates the “profit” that an organization will derive from a customer in the future. Although many advanced techniques have been proposed, the recency/frequency/monetary value (RFM) segmentation framework, and its related probability models, remain a CLV mainstay; We are going to use RFM technique in our study to analysing customer behaviour such as how recently a customer has purchased (recency), how often the customer purchases (frequency), and how much the customer spends (monetary). We will identify different customer types by segmenting the customers for different marketing strategies. We will predict the customers lifetime value using Markow Chain Model(Migration Model) At last we will identify the association between products items purchased together by a customer with similar RFM value and with similar demographic variables by using Association Rules method which for recommendation of products to the customers, which results in better customer satisfaction and cross selling.
